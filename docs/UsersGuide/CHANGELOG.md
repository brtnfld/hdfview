## Major Bug Fixes

* **Other HDF4/HDF5 installations no longer prevent HDFView from starting**: HDFView ships its own copies of the HDF4 and HDF5 libraries, but the operating system could load a different installation in their place if one was visible to it — through `PATH` on Windows, or `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` on Linux. When that installation was a different version, HDFView usually failed to start, reporting "failed to launch JVM".

  The bundled libraries are now pinned when HDFView is packaged, so they are used regardless of whatever else is installed on the machine.

  Consequently, `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` can no longer be used to make an installed HDFView load a *different* HDF4/HDF5 build. This applies to the packaged application only, as running HDFView from a source build is unchanged, and still uses the libraries named in `build.properties`.

## Minor Bug Fixes

# ☑️ Platforms Tested

HDFView is built and tested with **HDF 4.3.X** and **HDF5 2.Y.Z** on the following platforms:

* Linux (Ubuntu 24, Fedora)
* Windows
* macOS (amd64, intel)

Current test results and detailed platform information are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdfview).

# ⛔ Known Problems

* **Large Dataset Handling**: HDFView currently cannot nicely handle large datasets when using the default display mode, as the data is loaded in its entirety. To view large datasets, it is recommended to right click on a data object and use the "Open As" menu item, where a subset of data to view can be selected.

* **Object/Region References in Compound Types**: Object/region references can't be opened by a double-click or by right-clicking and choosing "Show As Table/Image" when inside a compound datatype.

* **Export Dataset in Read-Only Mode**: If a file is opened in read-only mode, right-clicking on a dataset in the tree view and choosing any of the options under the "Export Dataset" menu item will fail with a message of 'Unable to export dataset: Unable to open file'. The current workaround is to re-open the file in read/write mode.

* **Recent Files Button on Mac**: The 'Recent Files' button does not work on Mac due to a cross-platform issue with SWT.

* **PaletteView Selection**: Selecting and changing individual points in PaletteView for an image palette is broken.

* **Source Rebuild Requirements**: Logging and optional HDF4 requires rebuilds from source.

* **Mac File Display**: Automatically opening HDFView and displaying a file selected still does not display the file on a mac.
